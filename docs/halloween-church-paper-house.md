# Halloween Church Paper House Assembly Instructions

## Step 1: Prepare the main body

1. Take the main body of the church
2. Find all the fold lines and fold them away from you
3. Once everything is folded, connect the two sides together
4. Now the base of your church is ready

## Step 2: Attach the porch front

1. Take the porch piece (the one with the bat design)
2. Fold along all the scored lines, again away from you
3. Insert the tabs into the slots on the main body and secure them by folding the tabs inward
4. Now the porch is attached

## Step 3: Add the roof

1. Fold the roof along the scored line
2. Notice the cut-out in the middle of the roof â€” it should fit over the porch front
3. Place the roof on top to check alignment before gluing
4. Apply glue on the tabs of the roof (and you can also add some glue inside along the slots)
5. Start with the back side: attach the roof, check that the edges are even, and press to secure
6. Then attach the front side with the cut-out, fitting it neatly over the porch. It's easier to do this with the piece resting on the edge of a table

## Step 4: Assemble the tower

1. To make the cone top, fold along the scored lines and connect the tabs to form a triangle-shaped cone
2. Take the rectangular tower part and fold it along the lines as well
3. Insert the cone into the rectangular base, aligning the tabs and locking them in place

## Step 5: Attach the tower

1. Fold the tower walls along the lines and secure the tabs
2. Place the cone top onto the tower and fold the tabs inside (you can add glue for extra hold)
3. Insert the tower into the special cut-out on the church body
